pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Project Overview
This project leverages a dataset of crop yield information and related environmental variables to build a prediction model. It includes:

**Data preprocessing**
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Model training and evaluation for yield prediction
Data
The data used in this project is in CSV format, expected to be structured with various columns representing factors such as climate, soil properties, and crop type.

Ensure that the dataset is located at the specified path in the code, or modify the code to point to your dataset's path.

**Usage**
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Open the crop-prediction.ipynb notebook.
Execute the cells step-by-step to:
Load and preprocess the data
Perform EDA with visualizations
Train machine learning models to predict crop yield
Results
The model's performance and insights from the visualizations provide guidance on which features are most impactful for predicting crop yields.
